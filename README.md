# Unity Cinemachine Custom Script
 These script will help you to handle the different part of the unity cinemachine automatically when set up during playmode
 
 Here you can find the following script
 
 1) AutoAddPlayerToVcamTarget script which is used to automatically tag a gameObject thereby making the cinemachine to "follow" and "LookAt" the gameObject transform during gameplay. It is useful to Tag spawn gameObject or other things depending on your uses. If you have any problem with tihs script simply change the void Start() to void Update()
 
2) FOVController script which is used to to control the verticalFOV of the cinemachine thereby making a zoom in and zoom out effect. You can either use the mouse scroll wheel or the vertical direction of the keyboard to change the VerticalFOV.
